**Question 1**

Write a program that checks which numbers from a series of numbers entered by the user are prime numbers.

The program should get a number from the user and then display the messages:

•   "Not greater than 1" if the number entered is 1 or less

•   "Is prime" if the number entered is a prime number

•   "Is not prime" otherwise.

The user should then be asked if they want to enter another number and the program should repeat if they say that they do.

A prime number is a positive integer that will leave a remainder if it is divided by any positive integer other than 1 and itself.

You may assume that each number entered by the user is an integer.

If your program only works correctly for some prime numbers you will get some marks for this question. To get full marks for this question, your program must work correctly for any valid integer value that the user enters.

Evidence that you need to provide

(a)  Your PROGRAM SOURCE CODE.

(12)

(b)  SCREEN CAPTURE(S) showing the result of testing the program by:

•   entering the number 1

•   then choosing to enter another number

•   then entering the number 5

•   then choosing to enter another number

•   then entering the number 8

•   and then choosing not to enter another number.

**Question 2**
Insertion Sort
The insertion sort algorithm sorts an array by maintaining two sub arrays.  The sorted subarray - located at the front of the given array and an unsorted subarray.  
It starts by comparing the second element in the array to the first (sorted subarray) and shifts the element down if it is larger than the element to insert.  It repeats this process until the sorted array contains all the elements to be sorted and the unsorted subarray becomes empty.
The image below demonstrates how the insertion sort can be used to sort the given array.
